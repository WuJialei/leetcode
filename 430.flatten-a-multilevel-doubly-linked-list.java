 * You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and
 * previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point
 * to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more
 * children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as
 * shown in the example below.
 * 
 * Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly
 * linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * ⁠1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
 * ⁠        |
 * ⁠        7---8---9---10--NULL
 * ⁠            |
 * ⁠            11--12--NULL
 * 
 * Output:
 * 1-2-3-7-8-11-12-9-10-4-5-6-NULL
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Explanation for the above example:
 * 
 * Given the following multilevel doubly linked list:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * We should return the following flattened doubly linked list:
